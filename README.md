# Idea
The idea of the project is to use Android Studio (Java) to create an application that displays many foodtrucks available in Kuwait. Our problem is that many foodtrucks in Kuwait are local projects and they are not supported enough. Therefore, there should be an application that displays their foodtruck name, location, social media, and the type of cuisine in order for people to know where these foodtrucks are located. With that being done, many people will be able to enjoy the different type of foodtrucks and most importantly support these small projects!

The main section in the project are:
Main Screen -> Name and email to be entered.
Home -> All foodtrucks available
Cuisines -> Type of foodtruck cuisines which contains the foodtrucks inside.
Support -> Email or Call application support, it can be for both customers and if anyone wants to add their foodtruck to the application.
Logout -> Leave to the main screen

# Future Work
Add another section to the application where it can filter foodtrucks depending on their location. Moreover, which is the most important thing to be done is to have a sign up and sign in screen replaced instead of the main screen.
